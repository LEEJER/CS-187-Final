            Hey, my name is Jeremiah Lee. 
            <br><br>
            I am a freshman at UMass Boston, majoring in Computer Science. <br>
            Currently I am taking CS-187 as a course, and this site is my final project.
            <br><br>
            I was born in a small city north of Boston, and have lived here for the past 18 years of my life, with my 4 siblings and both parents.
            <br><br>
            Since I was young, I have enjoyed programming. I started out using Scratch--though it isn't a programming language--to make games and small projects. Around highschool, I started getting pretty serious about programming, as I learned JavaScript from one of my friends, and took a class on C++. Since then, I have been having a blast writing code and solving problems.
            <br><br>
            I haven't completed any original and substantial projects yet, though I was on a small development team for an app for my highschool. Unfortunately this app got cancelled right before completion for public use. There were issues with the school not being able to pay for or sustain the app.
            <br><br>
            In case you couldn't tell, I prefer dark mode on everything.
            <br><br>
            I don't think I have developed much in an academic sense, over the past semester. As someone who has a handful of prior experience in many of the topics first year classes cover, there wasnt a whole lot to learn. I do, however, feel that next semester I am probably going to learn quite a bit. 
            <br><br>
            I do also feel that being remote has made me slightly lazier than I already am. Everything is easier to access and deadlines can be pushed off more.
            <br><br>
            This project has been a fun thing to do, mostly to show off a bit-- give myself an ego boost before the next semester probably will hit me like a truck.
            </p>
