            Hey, my name is Jeremiah Lee. 
            <br><br>
            I am a freshman at UMass Boston, majoring in Computer Science. <br>
            Currently I am taking CS-187 as a course, and this site is my final project.
            <br><br>
            I was born in a small city north of Boston, and have lived here for the past 18 years of my life, with my 4 siblings and both parents.
            <br><br>
            Since I was young, I have enjoyed programming. I started out using Scratch--though it isn't a programming language--to make games and small projects. Around highschool, I started getting pretty serious about programming, as I learned JavaScript from one of my friends, and took a class on C++. Since then, I have been having a blast writing code and solving problems.
            <br><br>
            I haven't completed any original and substantial projects yet, though I was on a small development team for an app for my highschool. Unfortunately this app got cancelled right before completion for public use. There were issues with the school not being able to pay for or sustain the app.
