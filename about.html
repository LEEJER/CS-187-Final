        <p class="s-text">
                This webpage was made entirely by me. <br><br>
                There was no copy/paste used for any of the HTML or CSS. Where the sources used were only for reference.<br><br>

        <h2>Notable Features:</h2>
        <div class="two-column s-text" style="grid-template-columns: 30% auto">
            <p>Animation:</p>
            <p>The buttons in the nav-bar are animated to change size when you hover and click. This is done using the "transition" property.</p>
            <p>Smooth Scrolling:</p>
            <p>If you click the button that links to the page you are currently on, the page will scroll down to hide the banner at the top.</p>
            <p>Custom Scrollbar:</p>
            <p>Notice that the scroll bar on the right is blue and round. Though, I'm not certain if this effect works on all browsers and platforms, since I have not checked.</p>
            <p>Footer:</p>
            <p>I have a footer at the bottom of the page. Not sure what I should add to it.</p>
            <p>Box Shadows:</p>
            <p>The navbar and the image on the home page both have subtle shadows. I think it looks nice and adds a bit of depth to the whole thing.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Subtle Features:</h2>
        <div class="two-column s-text" style="grid-template-columns: 30% auto">
            <p>Grid:</p>
            <p>I used the grid properties of CSS to create the two column effects on various pages with relative ease.</p>
            <p>Custom Font:</p>
            <p>I imported fonts from Google Fonts</p>
            <p>Variables:</p>
            <p>I used variables for several colors in the CSS, so that main things such as background color and font color</p>
            <p>Text Selection:</p>
            <p>The header text cannot be selected/highlited.</p>
            <p>Draggability:</p>
            <p>The images and links cannot be dragged to different locations.</p>
